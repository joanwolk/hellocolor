#hellocolor

This is a learning project, and part of learning is to write a proper
README file, so here goes.  

In the model of README-driven development, I'm writing this before
the project has full functionality, so please bear with me.  

**[hellocolor][]** is a Ruby web app using Sinatra. It allows users
to change the color of the "Hello World!" text via radio button selection.
